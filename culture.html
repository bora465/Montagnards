        <p>Before the French left the Central Highlands, they promised the Montagnards protected land but they did not kept the
            promised. In 1960, the Communist government of North Vietnam included the right for highlander autonomy, but the Montagnard was suspicious of it. 
            Meanwhile, South Vietnamâ€™s President Ngo Dinh Diem neglected education and health care in the Highlands which the Montagnards didn't have access to. 
            <p>Before the Vietnam War, the Montagnard have a long history of tensions with the Vietnamese. There were
            problems over language and culture, land ownership, access to education and natural resources, and over
            representation in political. The Vietnamese started to called the Montagnards moi, meaning savage.To go against the Vietnamese, the Montagnard launched a movement known as BAJARAKA in 
            1958. There was also a military force within the community known as FULRO (United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races).

            <p>As the Vietnam War begun, the U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets) begin to train and bonded with the 
                Montagnard military, who regarded them as courageous fighters and loyal friends. The Montagnards were great
                allies due to the fact that they knew their land better than anyone. The South Vietnamese government
                collapse in 1975, and with the new Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the officials began to suspect the Montagnards as
                they were cooperated with the Americans and due to this were subjected to persecution, imprisonment, or death. 
                Many fled to Cambodia to organized a resistance but were ultimately persecuted by the Khmer Rouge. By 1985, Americans
                have become aware of the circumstances and arrange Montagnard refugees to enter the United States. </p>
            <p>Many Montagnards fled to the jungles and into Cambodia in order to get away from the Vietnamese and become a refugees
                in the United States. Males were usually the one that went through the journey because of the obstacles such as being caught
                or catching a disease. After the men have successfully enter America, they have to go through paperwork to be able to work
                in order to led a better life for them and there families. After countless years in America, the family of the men that went
                through the journey would be able to bring their families in the United States and be with them once again.

        <p>Montagnards have different tribes within the Central Highlands meaning that there are multiply
            languages/dialect. Surpisingly, there are more then 30 distinct Montagnard languages.  The most prevalent
            found in the world are Rhade, Jarai, Koho, and Mnong. Montagnards immigrants children coming to the United States
            when they were young, would most likely forget their mother tongue due to become westernize and growing up in 
            America. The Montagnards' elders are trying to perserve the culture so there are classes on Montagnards' languages
            that is avaliable.

            <p>Before the French colonization in the Central Highlands during the 1600s, the Montagnards practiced an animist
            religion that included a belief in many gods and also believed in evil spirits. Some Montagnards were converted 
            into Catholicism during the French exploration in the Central Highlands, but in the last 60 years, American
            missionaries have converted most of the Montagnards into evangelical Protestant Christianity. Most Montagnards in 
            the United States are active Christians.</p>
